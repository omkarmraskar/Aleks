    It consists of following features:
    - A pen to draw or edit atoms, groups, bonds, etc.
    - An eraser to erase somethingon the board.
    - A Pointer icon that can move atoms, bonds or curved arrows as well as move copy or delete molecules.
    - A button to add or increase positive charge on atom/molecule.
    - A button to add or increase negative charge on aton/molecule.
    - A button to add or increase lone pairs an atom/molecule.

    It also has undo and redo buttons to undo or redo some actions.
    It also has a button to start everything over.

3. To the right of this there is a vertical menu consisting of five options

   It consists of options in two sections:
    a) this consists of various button for following: - Add or increase positive charge on atom/molecule. - Add or increase negative charge on aton/molecule. - Add a lone pair. - Add 2 lone pairs. - Add 3 lone pairs. - Remove atom or group.
    b) Add atom or group.

   At the bottom of the dialog box there is a button to change order of atoms.
